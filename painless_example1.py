# Painless Python
# A ridiculously deep dive into the the print function

# Example 1
# Sending a message to something somewhere somehow

# Minimum viable Python script

def main(): # Define a function called main
    print("Hello, World!") # Print an argument to the terminal

# What is a script?
# What is a function?
# What is a argument?
# What is a terminal?

# Use a conditional statement to perform a test when loading this script
if __name__ == "__main__": # if the process is named __main__
    main() # Call the main function
else:
    pass # Don't do anything

# What is a conditional statement?
# What does loading mean?
# What does run mean?
# What does process mean?
# If we run this script again and again, what will happen?
