# Painless Python
# A ridiculously deep dive into the the print function

# Example 1
# Sending a message to something somewhere somehow

# Minimum viable Python program
def main(): # Define a function called main
    print("Hello, World!") # Print a message passed in an arugment to the terminal

# What is a program?
# What is a function?
# What is a argument?
# What is a terminal?

if __name__ == "__main__": # if run, run it as a script, else just load it as a module
    main() # Call the main function when the script is run
