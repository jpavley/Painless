## Backlog

- Document full setup, configuration, and installation instructions for all libraries and resources required to use the repo.
- Automate the process of set, configuration, and setup, configuration, and installation with Pythons virual invironments and or a cloudspace.

- The OpenAI response in example4_4 is unreliable and error prone... fix it!
- Reorganize the repo so that the source is easier to work with.
- Add an FAQ file.
- Add a contributers file.
- Add a code of conduct file.
- Include references in the readme.md to a few tools I forgot to mention: Github Desktop and the VS Code plugins (Github Copilot and Copilot Chat, markdownlint, Pylance, Python, Python Debugger, and Rainbow CSV).
