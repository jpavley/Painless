## Introduction

- 60 minutes to learn something about Python.
- No previous knowledge of computer science required.
- Not going to spend much time on theory.
- Weâ€™re going to explore and try things out and see where it takes us.

## Who am I?

- John Pavley, head of product & engineering for News Corp.
- This is how I learned to code, 35 years ago.
- Just dive in with a tutorial, follow along as best you can, ask a lot of
questions, develop an intuitive understanding before you a theoretical one.

## Notes

- The code for this introduction is hosted by **Github**. You can sign up for Github here: <https://github.com/pricing> (Choose the free option!)
- This document is written in **markdown** and the examples use markdown as well.
<https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/>
- The examples use a CSV file from **Kaggle**:
<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zsinghrahulk/us-presidents-age-state-health-and-wealth?resource=download>
- My preferred IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is **Visual Studio Code**.
It's free and better than most other IDEs. <https://code.visualstudio.com>
- If you're going work with data you need the **Pandas** library.
<https://pandas.pydata.org>
- There are hundreds of Python resources online. I recommend you start with
**Python.org**. <https://www.python.org>
- In the final example I use the **OpenAI API** and the **OpenAI Python Library**.
