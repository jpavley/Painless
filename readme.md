# A Painless Introduction to Python Programming

<jpavley@newscorp.com>

- 60 minutes to learn something about Python
- No previous knowledge of computer science required
- Not going to spend much time on theory
- Weâ€™re going to explore and try things out and see where it takes us

## Who am I?

- John Pavley, head of product & engineering for News Corp
- This is how I learned to code, 35 years ago

## Notes

- This document is written in markdown and the examples use markdown as well. <https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/>
- The examples use a CSV file from Kaggle: <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zsinghrahulk/us-presidents-age-state-health-and-wealth?resource=download>
- My preferred IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is Visual Studio Code. It's free and better that most of the commerical IDEs. <https://code.visualstudio.com>
- There are hundreds of Python resources online. I recommend you start with Python.org. <https://www.python.org>
